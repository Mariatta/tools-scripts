<p>Dear $name,</p>

<p>
    Thank you for signing up for the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcing-the-diataxis-documentation-workshop/17075">Di√°taxis Documentation Workshop</a> series organized by the Python Docs community.
</p>

<p>
    We received more applicants than the slots available. At this time, you have been placed on our waiting list; should there be a cancellation and a spot opens up, we will reach out to offer it to you. If you are no longer interested, please let us know so we can withdraw you from the waitlist.
</p>

<p>
    We are still planning to record the non-interactive portions of the sessions, and will send out the video to anyone who signed up.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you,
</p>
<p>
    Mariatta, Ned, and CAM, on behalf of the Python Docs community.
