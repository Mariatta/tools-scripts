<p>Dear $name,</p>

<p>
    Thank you for signing up for the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcing-the-diataxis-documentation-workshop/17075">Di√°taxis Documentation Workshop</a> series organized by the Python Docs community.
</p>

<p>
    We are pleased to inform you that your application was accepted and your attendance is confirmed!
</p>
<p>
    As a reminder, the workshop consists of two sessions that will take place on August 16 and 18, from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Di%C3%A1taxis+Workshop+Session+1%3A+Introduction+to+Di%C3%A1taxis&iso=20220816T16&p1=%3A&ah=2">16:00 - 18:00 UTC</a>. You will be sent separate calendar invitations along with the video call link for joining the workshop.
</p>

<p>
    We will be recording the presentation component of the sessions, but not the interactive portions. If you prefer not to be recorded, please let us know.
</p>

<p>
    We received more applicants than the slots available in the workshops, and we have quite a number of people on the waiting list. If you are no longer able to fully participate in both these interactive sessions, please let us know as soon as possible, so we can offer your spot to someone else.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about attending the workshop, please don't hesitate to reach out by responding to this email.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you there!
</p>

<p>
    Mariatta, Ned, and CAM, on behalf of the Python Docs community.
